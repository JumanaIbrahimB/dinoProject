# dinoProject
This is the first project in Intermediate JavaScript - MCIT, Udacity.
This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of working with object-oriented javascript. The functionality I use serves two purposes: to improve my experience building objects with javascript as well as taking advantage of user interaction with the DOM. This project is a stepping stone in my journey which takes advantage of many of the topics I learned in this course.
